Background

This data visualization portrays the teams participating in the 2022 Qatar World Cup in a global map, colorized by their respective groups. Interact with the map by scrolling the bar from the first world cup to the 2022 rendition, and watch as the circle of each nation grows given each appearance. Also, click on a country to get some insight on the group they're playing in and a player of theirs to watch. If you'd like to focus on a group, toggle to the correct group on the upper right side!

Features

You are able to:

1. Visualize the historical prominence of each nation involved in the 2022 World Cup by scrolling the bar at the top and watching each nation grow in congruence with their appearance count. 

2. Click on the nation to see important information for the 2022 World Cup, like a player to watch, their schedule, etc.

3. Specify which group you would like to narrow in on by toggling in the top left. 

4. See the champion of each year, signified by their circle being replaced by their flag!

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
-I have found a good database that contains all of the necessary information for past world cups, not much in terms of API:
https://github.com/openfootball/worldcup
-Great API Steve showed me which should help with getting the map pretty easily:
https://github.com/d3/d3-geo

Plan for implementation:

Friday
-Focus on setup of the project, get familiarized with each class that needs to be implemented. Establish that the countries points are being rendered in the correct places

Weekend
-Nail down the functionality of the bar's relationship with each circle. Research each team to have the information for their popup ready before Tuesday 

Monday
-Implement the group functionality. Create the toggle bar in the top right which will allow the user to view only a specific group's nations

Tuesday
-Create each teams popup, stylize each one uniquely if there is time

Wednesday
-Focus on styling and general look of the project(stylize the popups distinctly if timeline seems possible)

Thursday Morning
-Github
